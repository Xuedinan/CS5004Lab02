:star:  **Weekly report**

This week, I learned the three major topics, Override method (like toString()), how to use static variables when designing class, and what’s exception handling and the use case for it. 

For the override method, it’s more like we extend a class with certain method, and we are able to re-write the method based on our own application. For the static, it’s the scope of a variable or method that we could use it to make them be usable when calling the class by itself, not just calling it only by creating objective before. For the exception handling, it’s a smart way and option to make our program not crash, especially when there are uncertain cases we can’t 100% control, like opening a file or asking the user to input some content.

For the following extensions, I'm expecting to have more introduction videos for the concept of designing of a program. And I’d like to learn a strategic way to design classes with manipulation of using public, private, static, final, exception, etc.. Also I’m glad to have more practice along with code demo videos, that’s really helpful content for study.
